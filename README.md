**NOTE: This addon, for now, does not contain an actual Actor, despite having `lua/entities/CombineHunter.lua`. Instead, sound overrides are done there. Not sure if I'll make a Combine Hunter Actor.**

For now, this addon simply replaces the Half-Life 2: Episode Two Hunter sounds, with scarier, echoing variants, depending on the distance to you.
